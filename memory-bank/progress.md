# Progress

## What Works
- The "elements rethouse real estate theme" is present and its structure (HTML-MASTER for source, PROPERTY for build output) is understood.
- Netlify CMS admin interface (`admin/index.html`) and configuration (`admin/config.yml`) files have been created in the `PROPERTY` directory.
- A link to the CMS admin has been added to the site's navigation (in `HTML-MASTER/assets/html/partials/navbar.html`, which will be reflected in `PROPERTY` after build).
- Netlify deployment configuration (`netlify.toml`) has been set up at the repository root, specifying the build command and publish directory.
- Placeholder directories for CMS content (`src/properties`, `src/data`) have been created.
- **Resolved `node-sass` Python dependency error**: Replaced `node-sass` with `sass` in `package.json`.
- **Resolved `calc()` operation error**: Modified `_nice-select.scss` to use Sass interpolation for `calc()` expressions.
- **Resolved `owl.carousel` image path error**: Implemented a targeted override in `_video-override.scss` and adjusted `_owl.carousel.scss` to import it, ensuring correct image resolution.

## What's Left to Build
- **Content Integration**: The HTML templates in the `PROPERTY` directory need to be modified to dynamically pull content from the CMS-managed Markdown/YAML files. This is the most significant remaining task for full CMS functionality.
- **Image Handling**: Ensure images uploaded via CMS are correctly referenced and displayed on the site.
- **Full CMS Collections**: While properties and general text are prioritized, other sections like blog posts, agents, and testimonials can be integrated later.

## Current Status
The project is now building successfully locally, and all known build-related errors have been addressed. The core CMS setup is in place, and the site structure is prepared for dynamic content. The current status is ready for a new Netlify deployment attempt.

## Known Issues
- **Local CMS Testing**: Due to `python3 -m http.server`'s MIME type limitations for `.yml` files, the Netlify CMS cannot be fully tested locally. Full verification requires deployment to Netlify.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initial decision to use Netlify CMS was confirmed by user's preference for ease of use for non-technical users.
- The decision to modify `HTML-MASTER` and rebuild was made after realizing the `PROPERTY` directory is a build output, ensuring changes propagate correctly.
- Prioritization of properties and general text for CMS integration was based on user feedback.
- Debugging process involved iterative analysis of Netlify build logs and local terminal errors, leading to fixes for `netlify.toml` placement, `node-sass` deprecation, Sass `calc()` issues, and `owl.carousel` image path resolution.
