# Product Context

## Purpose
The project aims to deploy a real estate theme to Netlify, making it accessible and easily manageable for non-technical users. This addresses the need for a dynamic website that can be updated without requiring coding knowledge.

## Problems Solved
- **Ease of Content Updates**: Non-technical users can update property listings, general site text, and other content without developer intervention.
- **Static Site Benefits**: Leverages Netlify's performance, security, and scalability for a fast and reliable website.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Utilizes a free/low-cost hosting solution (Netlify) and a free CMS (Netlify CMS).

## How it Should Work
The website will be a static site served by Netlify. Content will be managed through Netlify CMS, which integrates with a Git repository. When content is updated in the CMS, it will trigger a new build and deployment on Netlify, ensuring the live site is always up-to-date.

## User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive CMS Interface**: The CMS should be straightforward for non-technical users to navigate and use.
- **Seamless Content Editing**: Users should be able to easily add, edit, and remove properties and general site information.
- **Fast Website Performance**: The deployed site should load quickly and provide a smooth browsing experience.
